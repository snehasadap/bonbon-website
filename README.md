# bonbon-website
Followed JavaScript Mastery's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/QRrPE9aj3wI?si=4ju1ys6aX1PXp2oq) on YT for layout and animations, and added my personal touch - desserts! You can view the deployed site on your desktop [here](https://bonbon-desserts.net/).
## Getting Started
### Installation Requirements
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Instructions
  1. You will be using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for setting up your environment. Paste the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     npm init vite bonbon
      ```
  2. You will be prompted to select a framework. Select **Vanilla**, then **Javascript**. This will configure the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

  3. Check that Vite has been configured successfully by verifying that the following files are present in your directory:

     For this project, you can remove all these files, since you will be using mine. 

  4. Download the `bonbon-website` code as a `.zip` file, unzip it, then paste all the files in your workspace.    
  5. Install the dependencies
     ```sh
     cd bonbon
     npm install
     ```
 6. For the animations, you will need to install the [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) JavaScript library
    ```sh
    npm install aos
    ```
 7. Run the website in development mode
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
   You should see your code running at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). To stop running Vite, **ctrl + c** in your terminal.
